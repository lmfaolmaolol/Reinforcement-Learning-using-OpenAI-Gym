# Reinforcement-Learning-using-OpenAI-Gym
This repository contains the code for the cartpole and mountaincar environment in openAI gym and how i solved it using the q-learning algorithm

To replicate this on your device, make sure that the .pkl file and .py file are in the same folder as the .pkl file contains the q table and so you can run the program without training it once again

The .pkl file for the cartpole environment is in the cartpole.zip file
